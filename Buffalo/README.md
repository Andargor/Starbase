### Mining System

The mining system uses 3 basic chips, one for Control, one for Safety and one for Positioning.
I sometimes change the positioning, but currently you start with your aim point in middle of rock,
lasers will then go up, down, left, up, right, down, center and repeat.  At 15m from rock it seems to
get most of it.

You can see the pictures of my installation and of the turrets Rotation and Pitch settings in the
images folder here.
